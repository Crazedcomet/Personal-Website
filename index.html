        <p>This website is a work in progress and is my first computer science project! This website is being cooded 100% by hand, with no AI input or external help.</p>

        <h2>Hackathons</h2>
        <h3>Virtual Global Hackathon</h3>
        <p>In a team of 3, my partners and I developped an add-on to the Uber app to help disabled people commute with Uber more safely. 
            The project, titled Uber Ease, connects smaller businesses that provide lifts for people in wheelchairs, with demenia, e.t.c. locally,
            can be promoted on the Uber app (sort-of like Amazon) as an option (e.g. Uber X, Uber Pool and now, Uber Ease).

        <h3>Starterhacks</h3>
        <p>In a team of 4, my partners and I developped Tensor_Build; an drag and drop no-code web application for building tensorflow nerual networks. 
            Every "block" is a new layer, of which is function built with tensorflow in the flask backend. This goal of this project is to educate notice 
            hackers about AI; some people might pick up the logic of neural networks and how a few layers work by watching youtube videos, but don't understand
            how to make a neural network with tensorflow (since the sytax is confusing). Therefore, Tensor_build aims to bridge that gap, allowing it's user to
            drag layers to form a neural network and train it on the website. I worked on the backend, particularly the TensorFlow functions, as 
            debugging on all fronts.

    <h2>Personal Arduino Projects!</h2>
    <p>I received an Arduino Uno as a gift from one of my friends in September of 2023. 
        Little would I have known that this would commence a great software and hard ware journey! </p>
